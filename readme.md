## Adding the Event to your Menues 
If you dont want to use the `/tow` or you simply want to add a button into your Job menue to Tow a Vehicle, you can Trigger the Script's own event for that like this:

`TriggerEvent('erp_towscirpt:tow')`

## Does this generate Lag?
Since i got many requests on "Does this Script generate lag / how is its CPU time on resmon" 
i checked it and it was as i expected it: 0,00ms!
